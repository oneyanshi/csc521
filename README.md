#CSC-521
A repository for Design & Org Programming Lang (CSC-521), a 500-level core CS course
at American University in Washignton DC. Projects python-quirk, clojure-quirk, and prolog
are mostly done but require more nuance and coding to be fully finished. I may come back and
revisit the projects.

python-quirk and clojure-quirk, written in Python and Clojure respectively, are program(s) that
can run a program written in "Quirk," a grammar/language that the professor of the class provided. 

**Contains the following:**
* python-quirk
* clojure-quirk
* instaparseTest
* prolog
