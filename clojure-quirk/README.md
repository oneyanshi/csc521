# :cherry_blossom: :star2: clojure-quirk :star2: :cherry_blossom: 

A parser and interpreter written in Clojure for an imaginary grammar/language called Quirk.

- [ ] Need to work on interpreter 
- [ ] Clojure correctness ; coding standards check? 
- [ ] Flesh out README

If you already have leinigen, please follow these directions:
